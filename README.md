# Gold Prediction

This repository uses Python and machine learning techniques to predict the future prices of gold. The project is designed as a data science pipeline, leveraging historical gold price data and predictive modeling to forecast future trends.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for gold price prediction
- Written in Python, with code and analysis in Jupyter Notebooks
- Open source under the MIT License

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jgjh-jf/goldprediction.git
   cd goldprediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   (List any required libraries here, e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)

  

3. **Run the notebook:**  
   Open the Jupyter Notebook file (if available) to explore the data and model.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter Notebooks with data analysis and modeling code
- `data/` — Example datasets (not included by default, add your own historical gold price data)
- `src/` — Optional: Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, etc.
